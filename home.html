      <h3 id="cookie1">What is a Cookie?</h3>

      <p>
        A cookie is a small data packet that online services store in the
        browser. It
        is an essential technology for the operation of effective and modern
        user
        experience-providing online services, which is supported by all browsers
        today.
      </p>

      <h3 id="cookie2">How is a Cookie created?</h3>

      <p>
        First, the client‚Äôs computer sends a request to the server. At that
        point, the
        server creates a unique identifier and stores it in its own database,
        then
        sends the created cookie back to the client along with all the
        information.
        This information cookie is then stored on the client‚Äôs computer.
      </p>

      <h3 id="cookie3">How is a Cookie used?</h3>

      <p>
        When the client‚Äôs computer reconnects with the server, it pairs with the
        previously created and stored cookie. The server compares the received
        cookie‚Äôs content with the one it stored. This allows for easy
        identification,
        such as recognizing a logged-in registered user. Without this, for
        example,
        you wouldn't be able to log in to a website.
